;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file provides helper functions for debugging the key translation
;; of the kitty keyboard protocol. The main interactive command it provides is
;; `kkp-debug-describe-key-translation-chain'.
;;
;; The key translation process is broken into three stages:
;;
;;  1. Input decoding via `input-decode-map` (with a fallback to KKP helper functions if needed).
;;     This step converts raw terminal events into a canonical key sequence.
;;
;;  2. Normal binding lookup: the input-decoded sequence is checked against the
;;     active keymaps (local, minor, or global). If a normal binding exists,
;;     remapping via `local-function-key-map` is skipped.
;;
;;  3. If no normal binding is found, remapping via `local-function-key-map` is
;;     applied, followed by further translation via `key-translation-map`.
;;
;; The final key sequence and its associated command binding are then displayed,
;; with each stage output in aligned columns for clarity.
;;
;; To use these debugging helpers, you can either:
;;
;;   M-x load-library RET kkp-debug RET
;;
;; or add (require 'kkp-debug) to your Emacs init file.
;;
